// ASSIGNMENT
// On line 6 create a variable called message and use a ternary operator to set the value of that variable to either

// 'Bobby is older'
// or
// 'Jill is older'
// Use the ternary operator and an inequality operator to dynamically determine which string to set as the value of message based on the bobbyAge and jillAge variables.
const bobbyAge = 17
const jillAge = 19

// don't touch above this line

// ?
const message = bobbyAge > jillAge ? 'Bobby is older' : 'Jill is older'

// don't touch below this line
