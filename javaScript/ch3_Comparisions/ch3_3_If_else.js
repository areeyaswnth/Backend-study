// ASSIGNMENT
// We need to keep mature movies away from children! I guess it's the law or something.

// Write two if/else blocks - one for Bobby and one for Jill. If Bobby is 18 or older, print Bobby is old enough, otherwise print Bobby is not old enough. Do the same for "Jill".

// WAIT, AREN'T BOBBYAGE AND JILLAGE HARDCODED? DO I REALLY NEED BOTH CONDITIONS?
// Well... yes they are, but we haven't learned about functions and loops yet, so humor me! Write out each condition just as if bobbyAge and jillAge could be anything. We'll learn about JavaScript's loops and functions soon. The muscle memory you'll get from writing the complete code will help you!
const bobbyAge = 17
const jillAge = 19

// don't touch above this line
if (bobbyAge >= 18) {
    console.log("Bobby is old enough")
}
else {
    console.log("Bobby is not old enough")
}
if (jillAge >= 18) {
    console.log("Jill is old enough")
}
else {
    console.log("Jill is not old enough")
}
// ?
