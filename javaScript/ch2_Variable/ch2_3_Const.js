// ASSIGNMENT
// We frequently get users inputting a username when we want an email. We have some code in MovieStarz that adds a gmail.com to a username and attempts to send a validation email if someone does that.

// The code has a bug! Use let instead of const to fix the bug.
let email = 'johndoe'

email += '@gmail.com'

// don't touch below this line

console.log(email)
