//ASSIGNMENT
// BOOTING UP THE "TEXTIO" SERVER
// All the code you write in this course is part of a larger product: an SMS API called "Textio". Textio sends text messages over the internet, it's basically a cute Twilio clone.

// Assignment: log starting Textio server to the console instead of hello world.
package main

import "fmt"

func ch1_1() {
	// single-line comments start with "//"
	// comments are just for documentation - they don't execute
	fmt.Println("starting Textio server")
}
